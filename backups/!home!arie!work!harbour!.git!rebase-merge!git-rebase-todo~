pick 2781190 wrapped all calls to policy_store_client in try/except (except calls that deal specifically with tags)
pick b0191f8 commented out remove_all_tags to circumvent branch

# Rebase 60e7f97..b0191f8 onto 60e7f97 (2 command(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
